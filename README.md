Installation
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

Project Motivation
For this project, I used open source database from Kaggle, that was made by scrapping the job posting of Data Scientist from www.glassdoor.com in USA. Dataset size is 742 rows x 42 columns.
Dataset was used to better understand:

1. Count Data Scientist open job position based on different location, company size, company revenue and industry sectors.
2. Explore the Data Scientist salary based on different location, company size, company revenue and industry sectors.
3. Required Computer science skills for Data Science job positions. 

File Description 
There is a notebook available here to showcase work related to the above notes. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.
There is an additional .py file that runs the necessary code to obtain the final model used to predict salary.

Results
The main findings of the code can be found at the post https://medium.com/@mmd2015medet/data-scientist-salary-study-in-2021-a469ab6ae303

Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements
